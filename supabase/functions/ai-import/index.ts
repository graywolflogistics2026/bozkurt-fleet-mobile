For amazon/walmart/homedepot/harborfright/store receipts use docType "amazon" (this is just an internal category name covering ALL store purchases, not literally Amazon):
{"docType":"amazon","date":"","vendor":"","totalAmount":0,"taxDeductible":true,"bizPct":100,"summary":"","purchase":{"orderNumber":"","items":[{"name":"","qty":1,"price":0}],"subtotal":0,"tax":0,"total":0,"paymentMethod":"BofA Business"}}
IMPORTANT: "vendor" MUST be the ACTUAL store/company name read from the document (logo, header, footer, or website URL shown) — e.g. "Home Depot", "Walmart", "AutoZone", "Amazon.com". Never default to "Amazon" unless the receipt genuinely is from Amazon. If a photo is blurry and the name truly cannot be read, set vendor to "Unknown Store" rather than guessing a specific brand.
CRITICAL QUANTITY & TOTALS RULES: "price" is the PER-UNIT price; "qty" is the quantity ordered. Look CAREFULLY for quantity indicators — on Amazon order pages the quantity often appears as a small number next to/below the product image, or as "Qty: N". Extract "tax" (sales tax) into purchase.tax. purchase.total and totalAmount MUST equal the invoice GRAND TOTAL (including tax and shipping). SELF-CHECK before answering: sum(price×qty for all items) + tax + shipping must equal the grand total — if it does not, re-read the document and fix qty or price.

For Zelle/Venmo/Cash App/PayPal payment confirmation screenshots (peer-to-peer payment sent from a PERSONAL account, e.g. "Your payment is sent", a "To:" recipient name, a "Message" field describing what was bought) — ALSO use docType "amazon" with the same schema. Map fields: vendor = the recipient's name (the "To" field), purchase.items[0].name = the "Message" field content (what was purchased) or "Private party purchase" if no message, purchase.total/totalAmount = the "Amount" field, date = the transaction date shown. Set purchase.paymentMethod to whichever app was used: "Zelle Personal", "Venmo Personal", "Cash App Personal", or "PayPal Personal" — this signals the purchase was paid from personal (not business) funds. bizPct should still be 100 if the item is a legitimate business expense (tools, electronics, truck supplies etc per the rule below).

IMPORTANT - Ali Bozkurt is OTR truck driver, sleeper cab is his home+office. ALL items 100% deductible: tools, TV, PlayStation, cooking appliances, electronics, bedding. Only groceries/medicine are personal.\n\nIn settlement deductions: any line item related to bookkeeping, accounting, tax prep, Abacus, or a registered agent/legal filing fee MUST be tagged \"Legal & Accounting Fees\"; any ELD, e-log, GPS, maps, load-board, or software service fee MUST be tagged \"Software & Subscriptions\" (not left blank or generic) so it can be tracked consistently across weekly settlements.

APPROVED ADDITION (fuel/IFTA, owner decision 2026-07-03): for docType "fuel", also extract the US state as a 2-letter code (e.g. "TX", "OK") into fuel.state, read from the station's address on the receipt. If the state genuinely cannot be determined, leave fuel.state as "".

APPROVED ADDITION (w2, owner decision 2026-07-03 — household tax design): for a W-2 tax form, use docType "w2" (not "other"): {"docType":"w2","date":"","vendor":"","totalAmount":0,"taxDeductible":false,"summary":"","w2":{"employer":"","employeeName":"","taxYear":0,"box1Wages":0,"box2FederalWithheld":0}}. vendor = the employer's name. date = the tax year's Dec 31 (e.g. "2026-12-31") if no other date appears on the form. totalAmount = box1Wages. taxDeductible is always false for a W-2 — it is income, not a business expense.

APPROVED ADDITION (item naming rules, owner decision 2026-07-07): every purchase item name must be accountant-readable — brand + product + model when the receipt shows them (e.g. "Milwaukee M18 Fuel 1/2in Impact Wrench", not "Impact Wrench" or "Item 1"). A fee/service/add-on line (shipping, protection plan, installation, gift wrap, warranty, "Add-on services", etc.) must state its purpose, and if it clearly covers one specific item on the same receipt, name that item in parentheses: "Extended warranty (for Milwaukee M18 Drill)". Never invent a vague generic name ("Misc item", "Product", "Item"). If an item's name genuinely cannot be determined from the document, set it to "NEEDS REVIEW: " followed by the verbatim text for that line from the receipt (e.g. "NEEDS REVIEW: SKU-88213-B").

APPROVED ADDITION (warranty extraction, owner decision 2026-07-07): a purchase item may carry warrantyYears (a number, halves allowed, e.g. 2.5 for a 2.5-year warranty) when the receipt states a warranty/protection-plan length for that item, and warrantyFor (the name of the item it covers) when the warranty is its own separate line rather than bundled into the item's own price. Omit both (or leave 0/"") when no warranty is stated.

APPROVED ADDITION (payment method classification, owner decision 2026-07-07): purchase.paymentMethod MUST be exactly one of these 9 values: "Business Checking", "Business Credit Card", "Personal Checking", "Personal Credit Card", "Cash", "Venmo", "Cash App", "Zelle Personal", "Zelle Business" — never a bank-brand string like "BofA Business". A card payment with no further signal defaults to "Business Credit Card". Venmo and Cash App payments are always personal funds — use "Venmo"/"Cash App" (there is no business variant for either). Zelle defaults to "Zelle Personal" unless the receipt clearly shows a business account/name as the payer, in which case use "Zelle Business".

APPROVED ADDITION (loads pickup/delivery dates, owner decision 2026-07-07 — feeds exact per-diem day-counting): for docType "settlement", each entry in settlement.loads should also include pickupDate and deliveryDate (both "YYYY-MM-DD") when the settlement/rate confirmation shows them. Leave them "" if genuinely not shown on the document — do not guess.

APPROVED ADDITION (payroll auto-routing, owner decision 2026-07-09): for docType "settlement", settlement.unit is the tractor/truck unit number and settlement.driverName is the driver's full name as printed on the settlement — most carrier settlements show both near the top or in a header/summary section. Extract both whenever shown; leave either "" if genuinely not present rather than guessing. Do not confuse driverName with the carrier name (settlement.carrier) — the carrier is the trucking company the settlement is issued by/through, the driver is the individual who ran the loads.
